The Idea of this app is provide a small companion app for the game "Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020" by Asobo and Microsoft.

### Current list of features that I strive to implement:
<ul>
  <li>List of all Aircrafts with technical imformation</li>
  <li>List of the hand built Airports with technical imformation</li>
  <li>Section with useful links to webpages of third party content</li>
  <li>small notebook to plan ideas for future flights</li>
</ul>

### Current list with planned features if possible:
<ul>
  <li>Logbook (if possible connected to the provided one with automatic updates, but this will probably not be possible)</li>
  <li>A plane matcher that chooses the perfect plane for your trip based on provided parameters</li>
  <li>Checklists for various planes</li>
</ul>

*Disclaimer: <br>
This list is subject to change.
Since I am not fully sure which skillsets we will aquire in this course some goals are dependent on the fact that we learn something to implement them or not.*

# Description of current features:

## Links to dedicated VATSIM data, like ILS approaches or transitions

Four buttons with important vatsim links can be found in the menu under "Vatsim"
Todo: more data should be added here

## Links to weather data, or built in ATIS

Maybe we can implement ATIS in the app for the current position or the closes airfield?

Link to the last patchnote
Possibility for a list with all patchnotes and all links to these full patchnotes
